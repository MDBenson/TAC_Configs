// Leonardo MPLM (became Permanant after STS-134)
// Requires ISS Community pack with MPLM module

// Because MPLM was largely used as either science and supplies and is
// now used as storage on ISS I just added Food but made extra Waste
// space as it's often used to store trash for disposal on Progress/ATV/HTV
